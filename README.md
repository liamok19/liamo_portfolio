# liamo_portfolio

## Description
- The objective was to create a portfolio website using Github pages as a bridge. The web page must be web accesible and have a visual treatment review. 
- A wireframe process will need to be created before implementation
- It was important that this review included a web accesibility and easy access for inclusive purposes. 
- The web page must:
- - Look good on a mobile device as well as desktop
- - Should have a navigation at the top.  When clicking these links it should take you to the relevant section on the page
- - Should have information about me (a bio)
- - Should have one main project link that is bigger than the others
- The biggest hurdle was the mobile responsiveness but once applying the appropriate media query in my CSS file it adapted the page accordingly.

## Strategy

1. Review the objective of the assignment and plan Computational Thinking. Decomposition, Pattern recognition, Abstraction and Algorithim. 
2. Build a wireframe (image reference below)
3. Create a repository first via github. Whilst including the new repo make sure that it's set to 'Public' and that you have the READme file attached. 
4. Git clone to your local server. 
5. Open both the HTML and CSS make sure that the CSS is linking up with the HTML. 
6. Refrencing the wireframe created, begin to build the box/es planned for this assignment. 
7. Go back to the goals that you have listed in Step 1 and work through them. 
8. Throughout the process continue to git commit messages of your updates and push to github. While you're pushing to github make sure your pushing the local folder so your work also versions up to github. 
9. Once your web page is looking like the objective set by the instructors deploy Github Link. 

## Assets
